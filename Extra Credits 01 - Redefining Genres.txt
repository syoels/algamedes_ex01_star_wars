Aesthetics of Play - Redefining Genres in Gaming - Extra Credits

Unlike other forms of art, computer games' genres are currently defined by the game's mechanics & dynamics (e.g. FPS), and not by their aesthetics (the emotive reason to play the game). The video argues this should change, and that we should start defining games' genres by their aesthetics, which can be roughly divided into 9 categories:
1. Sense pleasure: Play because of visuals, sound etc. 
2. Fantasy: Get to play an unrealistic roll. 
3. Narrative: Game as drama. 
4. Challenge: Game as obstacle course. 
5. Fellowship: Work cooperatively
6. Competition: Games as expression of dominance
7. Discovery: Discover something new. 
8. Expression: Fullfill the need to express yourself
9. Abnegation: Game as pastime, zone out. 

Portal (2007) is a first-person puzzle-platform video game. 
The game consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using "the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes.

Portal fits technically to the FPS (First Person Shooter) category, but aesthetics-wise it's more of a puzzle game.
