The next action of Clingger's brain follows the following logic (with this very priority): 
1. Shield against shots that are estimated to hurt Clingger
2. Remove shield if not necessary
3. If enroute towards collision with other spaceship & shield is up - do nothing.
4. Find the closest enemy ship and keep it as a target for a while
5. Raise shield if enroute towards collision with other SpaceShip
6. Move towards current target's general position
7. Shoot target if possible & if estimated hit
